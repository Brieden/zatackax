===== LINUX/BSD/UNIX-LIKE =====
To compile, type

    make

Compiling depends on the following libraries:

    SDL
    SDL_image
    SDL_ttf
    SDL_mixer

, which can be found on SDL's website: http://www.libsdl.org/. These
libraries are also provided in many of the most common Linux-distributions'
repositories.

Note that the build system is far from mature. So far, we've only tested the
game on a couple of Linux-machines, an OpenBSD-machine and a MW-machine. I
think it should be pretty smoothly portable though, so we'll be glad to hear
from you whether you are able to successfully build/run the game on your system
or not. See README for contact information.


===== MICROSOFT WINDOWS =====
To compile with Mingw32 you'll need these library files:

 - SDL-developer-mingw32:
    Version 1.2.14, http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
 - SDL_TFF: 
    Version 2.0, http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
 - SDL_IMAGE:
    Version 1.2, http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
 - SDL_Mixer: 
    Version 1.2.11, http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
    
SDL-developer-mingw32:
    Download SDL-devel-1.2.14-mingw32.tar.gz
    (http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.14-mingw32.tar.gz). Extract
    the content in lib\ into \masm32\lib and extract the content in include\
    into \masm32\include (make sure the SDL folder is included in the
    extraction). You should end up with \masm32\include\SDL\ and several
    header files within that subfolder.
    
SDL_TFF:
    Download SDL_ttf-devel-2.0.9-VC8.zip
    (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/release/SDL_ttf-devel-2.0.9-VC8.zip).
    Extract the content in lib\*.lib into \masm32\lib and extract the dll files
    into the zatackax\ folder. Extract the include\ content into
    \masm32\include\SDL.
    
SDL_IMAGE:
    Download SDL_image-devel-1.2.10-VC.zip
    (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/release/SDL_image-devel-1.2.10-VC.zip).
    Extract the content in lib\*.lib into \masm32\lib and extract the dll files
    into the zatackax\ folder. Extract the include\ content into
    \masm32\include\SDL.
    
SDL_Mixer:
    Download SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-VC.zip
    (http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/release/SDL_mixer-devel-1.2.11-VC.zip).
    Extract the content in lib\*.lib into \masm32\lib and extract the dll files
    into the zatackax\ folder. Extract the include\ content into
    \masm32\include\SDL.
    
DLLs needed to compile (either in folder or linked to):

 - SDL_ttf.dll
 - SDL_image.dll
 - SDL_mixer.dll
 - jpeg.dll
 - libtiff-3.dll
 - libpng12-0.dll
 - libfreetype-6.dll
 - zlib1.dll
 
To compile using make:
    make -f Makefile.w32
