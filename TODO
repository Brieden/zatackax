Stuff that needs to be done:
 *  the game needs a cool title screen.
 *  make sound effects for every weapon! The current sound effects are only
    temporary.
 *  fix a real winning screen.

Stuff that would be cool to have (wishlist):
 *  reuse of weapons during the same round, with cooldown effects similar to
    those found in the Warcraft/Red Alert series.
 *  special broadcast messages, e.g. when a player wins 5 matches in a row.
 *  make the code more modular for better maintainability.
