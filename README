===== ZATACKA X =====
Currently a very young project, which goal is to write a remake of Achtung,
die Kurve! In addition to all the features from the original game, Zatacka X
is aiming to include better graphics, special weapons, sound effects, AI
controlled opponents, a tournament mode, and possibly online play. The game is 
being written in C with SDL.
